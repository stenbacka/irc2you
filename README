Use Case: Get notified about highlights you receive your (supported) IRC
frontend. What notifications and where to send them can be configured.
Possible destination include email and Android notifications.

Basic flow: A plug-in to an IRC frontend catches and sends the highlight
(with some related information) to a server-like program that, based on
the user's configuration, propagates the highlight via some communication
channel.
